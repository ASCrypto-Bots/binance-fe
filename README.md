# binance-fe

1. Run the binance-api first (https://github.com/ASCrypto-Bots/binance-api)

2. Install the node modules

3. Use the npm run serve command to run the project

4. USE IT IN LOCALHOST (avoid deploy etc, it's still a wip and i suggest you to keep your secret in a secure place. If you are not sure that the secret is in a secure place, pls keep it in localhost)

I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor and this tool is not a money generator. Feel free to use it at your own risk.
